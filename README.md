# Python
A random assortment of python scripts.

## Py_Flatten
A script that takes an input png file and flattens the image either horizontally or vertically.
It does this by going through the image by rows or collumns and finding the dominant colour.
It then recreates the image using only the dominant colours of each row or collumn. 
This creates a "1D" representation of the image.
